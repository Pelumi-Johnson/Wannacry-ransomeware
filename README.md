This presentation breaks down the **WannaCry ransomware outbreak (May 2017)**—how it spread like wildfire through **unpatched Windows systems**, leveraged **EternalBlue (SMB)**, and what defenses helped stop the bleeding.

## 🎯 What This Presentation Covers
✅ What WannaCry is (crypto-worm ransomware)  
✅ How it spread globally in May 2017 using **EternalBlue**  
✅ Why outdated/unpatched systems were hit hardest  
✅ How the **kill switch domain** slowed the outbreak  
✅ Key prevention strategies: patching, segmentation, least privilege, incident readiness  

## 🧠 Key Takeaway (1 line)
A single unpatched weakness can become a worldwide storm—WannaCry proved why **patching + segmentation + readiness** must be non-negotiable.

## 🧰 Skills Highlighted
- Patch management awareness (MS17-010 context)
- Malware outbreak analysis (worm-style lateral spread)
- SMB / Windows exploitation awareness
- Defensive best practices (segmentation, endpoint protection, least privilege)
- Incident response mindset (containment + recovery)
